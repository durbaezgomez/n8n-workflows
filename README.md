# n8n Automations üöÄ  

This is a collection of **workflows**, where I‚Äôm exploring and building powerful automations to simplify daily tasks and improve productivity. 

## Tools
- n8n
- LLM API providers
- Custom scripting within workflows
- App integrations like Slack, Grafana, Google Suite, Siri Shortcuts (via webhooks) etc.
